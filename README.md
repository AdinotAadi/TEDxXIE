## TEDxXIE Website Deprecation Notice

Dear TEDxXIE Community,

After careful consideration, we have decided to deprecate the current version of the TEDxXIE website built using HTML, CSS, and JS. We are excited to announce the migration to a new and improved version developed with React and Tailwind CSS.

### New Repository and Live Deployment

You can find the code for the updated website on our new repository: [tedx-react-tailwind](https://github.com/AdinotAadi/tedx-react-tailwind). We encourage you to check out the repository for the latest updates, improvements, and features.

The live deployment of the new TEDxXIE website can be accessed at [https://react-tedx.netlify.app/](https://react-tedx.netlify.app/). We believe this transition will provide a better user experience and more flexibility for future enhancements.

### How to Migrate

If you have contributed to the current TEDxXIE website, we appreciate your efforts. To migrate to the new version, please follow the guidelines provided in the [new repository](https://github.com/AdinotAadi/tedx-react-tailwind). This will ensure a smooth transition and help us maintain the integrity of the project.

### Support and Feedback

We understand that change can sometimes be challenging, but we are confident that this upgrade will benefit the TEDxXIE community. If you encounter any issues or have feedback during the migration process, please don't hesitate to open an issue on the [new repository](https://github.com/AdinotAadi/tedx-react-tailwind).

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

Best regards,

The TEDxXIE Team
